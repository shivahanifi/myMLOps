    - Typically triggered by a new commit to the version control system, CI/CD pipelines guide changes through various stages until they safely reach the production environment.
    - **Why Use CI/CD for Machine Learning (Why is it crucial to package a model into a container instead of just reloading the serialized model file in the existing deployment?)** The key lies in pursuing an ‘immutable’ process — one that seamlessly runs through the same steps from start to finish, devoid of any ‘side effects’ that could complicate the troubleshooting of model behavior changes, such as disparities in Python package versions between data scientists’ laptops.
